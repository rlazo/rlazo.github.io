script he needs for his masters. And <em>my God</em>, that was one ugly
script. It was pretty obvious that the original author, not my
brother, didn't know very well how to write good scripts, neither was
interested in learning. A big hairy mess of R code. It was my first
time working with R and, while I didn't find it as ugly as I
originally though, I hope that I don't have to mess with it
too often.</p>
